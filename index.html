        <b>Summary:</b> We hope to render an animated simulation of jellyfish movement in water. Modeling the jellyfish as a cloth,
        applying hydrodynamic forces, and implementing ray tracing concepts to render a translucent skin will help us achieve
        a realistic representation of this beautiful marine creature.
    </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Problem Description:</h2>
    
    <p> We are inspired by the mystery of the ocean. Since we cannot easily see jellyfish up close  ourselves, we want to
        simulate jellyfish movement. In general, we wish to approach the problem of modeling animals and their movements.
        This is important because we might want to model jellyfish or other marine animals in an animated movie, etc., so
        this is a good opportunity to explore modeling biological movements. This problem is challenging because jellyfish
        move underwater, so there will be additional hydrodynamic forces to consider. In general, we plan to approach this
        problem by approximating the jellyfish as a cloth simulation. We will also apply translucent shaders to make more
        lifelike renders of the jellyfish.

        <p> Our goal is to create short videos that display how our jellyfish moves realistically. </p>

        <p> Baseline Goal: </p>
        <ul>
  <li>We plan to deliver an animated simulation of jellyfish motion by building upon concepts from the ray tracing and cloth simulation projects.</li>
  <li>We plan to modify the jellyfish as a cloth with strands of cloth that represent the tentacles and a set of springs to approximate muscle contraction. Using this model, we want to approximate realistic movement of jellyfish movement through water.</li>
  <li>After modelling the motion of the jellyfish, we plan to implement a shader to render the translucency and texture of the jellyfish. </li>
</ul>
        
        <p> Aspirational Goal: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> If things go well, we would like to implement fluid simulation in the same environment as the jellyfish using fluid dynamics models.</li>
            <li> Additionally, we hope to simulate light-scattering of the sun-light through the water projecting onto the jellyfish. </li>
        </ul>
            <p> To measure the quality of our simulation, we will compare our jellyfish renders and animation to videos of jellyfish in real life. We will put emphasis on evaluating how realistic the movement looks, such as if it is evident that the jellyfish is moving through water. We will similarly evaluate if the rendering looks lifelike compared to real images and videos. Through our analysis, we hope to answer how we can approximate jellyfish movement and shading using techniques we have already learned in past projects, in addition to using new concepts important for modeling jellyfish movement.
