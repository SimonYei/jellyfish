    <p> We are inspired by the mystery of the ocean. Since we cannot easily see jellyfish up close  ourselves, we want to simulate jellyfish movement. In general, we wish to approach the problem of modeling animals and their movements. This is important because we might want to model jellyfish or other marine animals in an animated movie, etc., so this is a good opportunity to explore modeling biological movements. This problem is challenging because jellyfish move underwater, so there will be additional hydrodynamic forces to consider. In general, we plan to approach this problem by approximating the jellyfish as a cloth simulation. We will also apply translucent shaders to make more lifelike renders of the jellyfish.
